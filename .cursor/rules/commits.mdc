[title]: # (Commit Conventions)

Use conventional commits with the following types:
- feat: for new features
- fix: for bug fixes
- chore: for maintenance tasks
- refactor: for code improvements without changing behavior
- style: for formatting or styling (no logic changes)
- docs: for documentation updates
- test: for adding or updating tests
Keep messages concise, lowercase, imperative, and under 72 characters.
Examples:
- feat: add dynamic route for event pages
- fix: correct missing location in event card
